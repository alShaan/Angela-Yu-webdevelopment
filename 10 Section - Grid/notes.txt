Flexbox : this is very helpfull for laying out 1-D.

Grid : this is very helpfull for laying out 2-D.

repeat values for grid template.

grid auto row property will be very helpful.

In flex box, Justify content is used to allign the element across the main axis and align-items is used to align the item across the main axis.

we can use the grid line numbers to position our element across the grid.

grid-column property is the shorthand for grid-column-start and grid column end.

we can use the chrome developer tool to get the line numbers and  we can also use the negative numbering.

basically,  grid-column: span 2;

this means,(grid-column-start) start where you are and (grid-column-start) end after 2 columns.

grid-area : row-start / col-start / row-end / col-end 
This only takes numbers as the input.

One of the biggest difference between the grid and flex box.

i.e. grid allows the element to overlap.
