Intermediate CSS
43. The Cascade - Specificity and Inheritance
In the Css it's all about which style is given more priority.

inline css >> internal css >> external css

Css according to the priority

position : property of overwriting

specificity : tag << class << class/element + attribute << id

type : external << internal << inline

!important : keyword (everything else will be ignored only this styling will take place).

We have 4 different values for the positions : static, relative, absolute and fixed.

Static positions : these are the html default once

website for better understanding :   https://appbrewery.github.io/css-positioning/

Relative positions : Position relative to the default position

Absolute Positioning : this makes the position relative to the nearest positioned or top left corner of the website .

Z-index : it determines which goes on top. eg: if *A has z index of 100 and *B has z index of 50 then *A is going to be on top of *B
