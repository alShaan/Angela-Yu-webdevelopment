55. Flex Direction
In Display flex property, the default direction of of the flex is Horizontal.

flex-direction property is set to row by default.

The horizontal axis is called as Main axis

and the vertical axis is called as cross axis

If the we set the display flex property to column .

Then vertical direction is stated as main axis.

and horizontal axis is stated as cross axis.

flex basis is a property which works with display flex property.

when you give them a property of flex-basis: 100px, it stretches the element in the main axis.

** Flex basis is set to the child elements

order property is set to the child of the parent who has flex property.

by default the order of the child element is set to 0.

Flex-wrap : nowrap

If this is your property then the element will stay on the main axis even if there is no space on the screen, this is the default property.

If you se the flex-wrap : wrap.

Then if the element does not fit horizontally they get shifted to the bottom.

justify-content: flex-start.

This is set to the parent container and this is the default property

Justify content basically sets the distribution of our items along the main axis.


align-items : flex-start;

this property is set to the parent and this is the default .

this property sets the distribution along the cross axis.

Priority for the sizing of the flex box

content width < width < flex-basis < min-width/max-width

These are for the children

All these property takes numbers as the value.

flex-basis : This is used to stretch cross the main axis.

flex-grow :The flex-grow CSS property sets the flex grow factor, which specifies how much of the flex container's remaining space should be assigned to the flex item's main size.



flex-shrink : The flex-shrink CSS property sets the flex shrink factor of a flex item. If the size of all flex items is larger than the flex container, items shrink to fit according to flex-shrink.



Short hand for all the 3

flex:  flex-basis flex-grow flex-shrink
