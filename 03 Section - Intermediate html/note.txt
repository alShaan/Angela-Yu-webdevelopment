Internet Simply connects client computer to the Server Computer.



Every websites have 3 basics file : Html, Css & JS

(Understand by the example of a house)

Html : Structure of the site i.e. bricks, shapes, buttons, wires, building block, foundation,etc.

Css : It is the designing and beautification part. i.e. Colour, size, textures, design, etc.

JS : Functionality i.e. a light bulb, the doorbell, coocker, stoves.



This helps us to maintain the seperations of concerns.

Html for Structure(content)

Css for Design

Js for Functionality.

ISP : internet service provider that connects you from one server to another.

DNS : Domain name server this will have all the IP address that you want to have access from youe ISP's.

Every Computer has there own IP adresses, That we can have access. we can connect from 1 server(computer) to another server(computer) Using there IP's.



Internet is just like connecting one computer with the another on a wider scale.
