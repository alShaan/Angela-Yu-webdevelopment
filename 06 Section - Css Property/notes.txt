38. CSS Colours
These are the units we use to size the fonts or the elements of the page

1px = 1/96th inch

1pt = 1/72 inch

*** 1em = 100% of parent element

eg : assume h1 having a font size of 1em and body is the parent element having size of 20px.

So, 1em is 100% of parent element i.e. 20px

So, 2em is 200% of parent element i.e. 40px

This type of unit is called the relative unit.

1rem = 100% or root element

root means parent of the parent i.e. from where it started.

h1 has parent body and body has parent html .

so the html is the parent tag.

so the rem unit behaves according to the root size.

if size of root is changed from 20px to 80.

then the element having 2rem, will change from 40px to 180px

basically, 1rem = 1*root size, 2rem = 2*root size, 3rem = 3 * root size, etc.




Static size unit : 1px and 1pt

Relative size unit : 1rem and 1em

Padding : gaps between the element and the border of the box.

Border

this is how border property is written. thickness style color; eg : border : 2px solid red;

we can give the property to the any of the side i.e. border-top, border-bottom, border-left, border-right.

we can use border width property if we give only one value all 4 side will have the same value throughout.

if we want to give all 4 different sides. border-width: 0px 10px 20px 30px; This will make changes from top right bottom and left making changes in the clockwise.

if we give only 2values to border width. border-width: 10px 15px; this will make the top and bottom border of 10px and left and right of 15px.
